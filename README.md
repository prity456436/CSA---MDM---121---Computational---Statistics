# CSA---MDM---121---Computational---Statistics
Section -B: Programming Tasks (MID-ll Assignments)


ðŸ“‚ Contents

Q1: Mean, Median, Mode, Weighted Mean
Calculates basic statistical measures (mean, median, mode) using Pythonâ€™s statistics module and includes a custom function for weighted mean.

Q2: Range, Variance, Skewness, Kurtosis
Computes range, variance, skewness, and kurtosis to analyze data distribution and spread.

Q3: Central Limit Theorem Simulation
Simulates repeated sampling to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem and visualize sample means approaching normal distribution.

Q4: Correlation & Regression
Performs correlation analysis and simple linear regression (e.g., study hours vs exam scores) to show relationships between variables.

Q5: Hypothesis Testing
Conducts a two-sample t-test to compare class averages and determine if the difference is statistically significant.
