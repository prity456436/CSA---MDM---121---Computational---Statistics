# CSA-MDM-121: Computational Statistics  
## Sectionâ€“B: Programming Tasks (MID-II Assignments)

This repository provides Python implementations for the **Sectionâ€“B Programming Tasks** of the course CSA-MDM-121.  

The programs are written with clear logic, comments, and outputs. Each task is kept in a separate file so that they can be run and tested independently.

## ðŸ“‚ Programs Included
- **Q1:** Calculate Mean, Median, Mode, and Weighted Mean for a dataset.  
- **Q2:** Compute Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation using stepâ€‘byâ€‘step formulas.  
- **Q3:** Simulate rolling two dice 10,000 times, estimate the probability of getting a sum of 7, and compare with the theoretical probability.  
- **Q4:** Find the correlation coefficient and fit a simple linear regression line (y = a + bx) for a sample dataset.  
- **Q5:** Perform a hypothesis test to check if the average marks of two classes are significantly different, with proper hypotheses and interpretation.
